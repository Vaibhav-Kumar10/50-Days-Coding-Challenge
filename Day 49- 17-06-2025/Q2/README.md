## 🔄 **Day 48 – Q2: Single Number**

**LeetCode Problem:** [136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Array, Bit Manipulation  
**Tags:** XOR, Unique Element, Constant Space

## 📄 Problem Statement

Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears _twice_ except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

## 🧠 Example

### Example 1:

Input: nums = \[2,2,1]
Output: 1

### Example 2:

Input: nums = \[4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4

### Example 3:

Input: nums = \[1]
Output: 1

## ✅ Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 × 10⁴`
- `−3 × 10⁴ <= nums[i] <= 3 × 10⁴`
- Each element in the array appears twice excepts for one element which appears only once.
