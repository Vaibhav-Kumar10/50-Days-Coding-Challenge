## üìÑ Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its _maximum depth_.

A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## üß† Example

### Example 1:

![maxDepth](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/tmp-tree.jpg)

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Output: 3

### Example 2:

Input: root = [1,null,2]

Output: 2
