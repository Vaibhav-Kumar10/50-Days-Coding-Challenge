## 📄 Problem Statement

Given the `head` of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in **ascending order**, convert _it to a binary search tree_.

---

## 🧠 Example

### Example 1:

![List2BST](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/17/linked.jpg)

Input: head = \[-10,-3,0,5,9]

Output: \[0,-3,9,-10,null,5]

Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height-balanced BST.

### Example 2:

Input: head = \[]

Output: \[]

## ✅ Constraints

- The number of nodes in `head` is in the range `[0, 2 * 10⁴]`
- `-10⁵ <= Node.val <= 10⁵`
