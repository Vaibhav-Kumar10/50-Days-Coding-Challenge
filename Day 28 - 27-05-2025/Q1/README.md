## 📄 Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

## 🧠 Example

### Example 1:

![minDepth](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/12/ex_depth.jpg)

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Output: 2

### Example 2:

Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]

Output: 5
