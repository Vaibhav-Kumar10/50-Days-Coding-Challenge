## 📄 Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return `true` _if and only if_ `s` _can become_ `goal` _after some number of **shifts** on_ `s`.

A **shift** on `s` consists of moving the leftmost character of `s` to the rightmost position.

- For example, if `s = "abcde"`, then it will be `"bcdea"` after one shift.

## 🧠 Example

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"

Output: true

### Example 2:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"

## Output: false

## ✅ Constraints

- `1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 100`
- `s` and `goal` consist of lowercase English letters.
