## 🧠 Examples

### Example 1:

Input: x = 121

Output: true

Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

### Example 2:

Input: x = -121

Output: false

Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

### Example 3:

Input: x = 10

Output: false

Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
