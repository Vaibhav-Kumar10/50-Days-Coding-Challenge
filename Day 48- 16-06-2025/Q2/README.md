## 🔄 **Day 46 – Q2: Hamming Distance**

**LeetCode Problem:** [461. Hamming Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/)  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** Bit Manipulation  
**Tags:** XOR, Count Bits, Binary Difference

## 📄 Problem Statement

The **Hamming distance** between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, return the **_Hamming distance_** between them.

## 🧠 Example

### Example 1:

Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:

```
1   (0 0 0 1)

4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑
```

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

### Example 2:

Input: x = 3, y = 1

Output: 1

## ✅ Constraints

- `0 <= x, y <= 2³¹ - 1`
