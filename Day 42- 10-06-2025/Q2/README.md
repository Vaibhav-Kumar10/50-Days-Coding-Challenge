## 📄 Problem Statement

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return _a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space._

**Note** that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

## 🧠 Example

### Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"

Output: "blue is sky the"

### Example 2:

Input: s = " hello world "

Output: "world hello"

Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

### Example 3:

Input: s = "a good example"

Output: "example good a"

Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
