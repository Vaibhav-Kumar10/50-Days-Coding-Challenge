## 🧠 Examples

### Example 1:

![lc-swapList](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/linked1.jpg)

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2

Output: [1,4,3,2,5]

### Example 2:

Input: head = [7,9,6,6,7,8,3,0,9,5], k = 5

Output: [7,9,6,6,8,7,3,0,9,5]

## ✅ Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
