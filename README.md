# 🚀 50 Days Coding Challenge – VIT Bhopal x FACE Prep 💻

Welcome to my journey through the **#DrGViswanathan Coding Challenge**, an initiative by **VIT Bhopal University** in collaboration with our training partner **FACE Prep**, aimed at celebrating **Mother’s Day** and **Father’s Day** by fostering discipline, consistency, and growth among students.

Over the next 50 days, I’ll be solving **two coding problems daily**:
- One from **Data Structures**
- One based on **Programming Fundamentals**

This challenge is especially designed for **Second Year students** to build strong problem-solving skills for both **product-based** and **service-based** company placements.
