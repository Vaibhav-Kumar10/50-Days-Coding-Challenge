## 📄 Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

If `target` is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

## 🧠 Examples

### Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8

Output: [3,4]

### Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6

Output: [-1,-1]

### Example 3:

Input: nums = [], target = 0

Output: [-1,-1]

## ✅ Constraints

- `0 <= nums.length <= 10⁵`
- `-10⁹ <= nums[i] <= 10⁹`
- `nums` is a non-decreasing array.
- `-10⁹ <= target <= 10⁹`
